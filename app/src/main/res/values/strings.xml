    <string name ="havingtrouble"><b>Having trouble getting answers?</b>\n\nWhat will frequently happen in math is that you will be unsure whether or not you’re doing a problem right or whether or not you have arrived at the right answer. This uncertainty can be incredibly frustrating to deal with, especially when you’re dealing with it for several problems rather than one. While it is not always to obtain perfect answers single-handedly or from someone else, the knowledge on how to maximize your chances of finding the correct answers can be obtained.\n\nWhen confronted with uncertainty, the first obvious thing to do is to google it. Type up the problem word for word, plug it into google, and see what you get. Plugging in the problem word for word is more likely to work for non-word problems, so for word problems a different approach must be taken. For word problems, you can either take a part of the word problem and google it or plug in the entire problem without any numbers. You will rarely get answers for the same exact problem with Google, but you will most likely end up getting information about nearly the exact same problem with different numbers.\n\nAnother good alternative to Google is WolframAlpha. While WolframAlpha will not be of help for word problems, if you are able to strip the problem down to a mathematical form (like an equation), then WolframAlpha can probably get you the answer. In addition to being able to provide information on equations, WolframAlpha allows you to query certain properties of an equation.\n\nExample:
    </string>
    <string name = "alg1_vars"><b>Variables</b>\n\nA variable is a letter that represents a number and the value of this number is either:\n-Unknown\n-Varying\n\nExample for a case of a variable representing an unknown number:\nx + 5 = 7\nWhat this equation means is stating is something plus 5 is equal to 7. Immediately, we do not know what x is; it is an unknown as far as we can tell.\n\nExample for a case of a variable representing a varying number:\nLet’s say you’re working as a waiter/waitress, and you make $80 a day. As a waiter/waitress, you also receive tips, so it’s more than likely that you will make more than just $80 a day. The actual amount of money you will make will be:\n\n$80 + t, where t represents the money you are making from tips\n\nBecause the amount of money you will obtain from tips varies, we cannot represent it as a solid number such at 5 or 10.\n\nIf you have obtained $20 on tips on Monday, then you have made $100 (80 base + 20 in tips) for the day; however, on Tuesday, if you have obtained $40 in tips, then you have made $120 (80 base + 40 in tips) for the day. As we can clearly see, the amount of money obtained in tips varies, which affects our quantity of daily wages.\n\nThe most common letter we will use to represent a variable is x, which is incredibly similar to the multiplication sign. Due to how x and the multiplication sign are indistinguishable, we will use * (an asterisk) to represent multiplication.\n\nSo instead of writing: 3 x 5 = 15\nWe will now write it as: 3 * 5 = 15</string>

    <string name = "alg1_PEMDAS"><b>PEMDAS</b>\n\nOften times in Algebra I and beyond, you will encounter an equation that looks like this:\n3 * 5 + 6 – 3 / 3\nAnd you will be told to evaluate what number this is. Naturally, you will evaluate it going from left to right, so your work will look like:\n<b>3 * 5</b> + 6 – 3 / 3 =\n<b>15 + 6</b> - 3 / 3 =\n<b>21 – 3</b> / 3 =\n<b>18 / 3</b> =\n<b>6</b>\n\nAlthough it is natural for you to proceed with solving the equation this way, you are shocked to find out that your answer is wrong. Why?\n\nIn order to solve the issue of how to proceed with complex math equations, an order of operations was established, telling people exactly what operation they should do first when faced with an equation containing numerous different operations. The most common one that is used (and the one we will be using) is PEMDAS.\n\nPEMDAS is an abbreviated form of the order of operations of Parenthesis Exponents Multiplication Addition Subtraction. What this tells us to do is:\n(NOTE: these steps must be done in the sequence given. If there is nothing that we can do on a step, we can then skip to the next step)\n-Apply PEMDAS to items in parenthesis first\n-Then simplify any number with exponents next if there are no more quantities in parenthesis to solve for\n- Once we are done with exponents, then we multiply\n-When there is nothing left to multiply, then we divide:\n-After we have done the above four things, we add whatever numbers need to be added:\n-Finally, we do our subtraction\n\nNOTES:\n-If you have troubling remembering PEMDAS, you can try memorizing it as an acronym for Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally\n-For repeats of the same operation (including separate quantities in parenthesis that are side by side but not incased in one another), we go from left to right. PEMDAS gives the order to do different operations, not the order to do several of the exact same ones.\nExample: 2 + 7 + 3 + 4 = 9 + 3 + 4 => 12 + 4 => 16\n-If we are unable to do something at any given step, we skip to the next one. If we are already at the end, then we are done!\n-If you are faced with an equation with multiple quantities in parenthesis and don’t know where to start, find the rightmost “(“. Then apply PEMDAS to the quantity encased inside of it, and repeat this procedure until there are no more quantities in parenthesis left.\n\nExample:\nWhat is (6 + 3) * 2 / 3 – 5 + 8?\n<b>(6 + 3)</b> * 2 / 3 – 5 + 8 =\n<b>9 * 2</b> / 3 – 5 + 8 =\n<b>18 / 3</b> – 5 + 8 =\n6 <b>- 5 + 8</b> =\n<b>6 + 3</b> =\n<b>9</b>\nBecause there are no usages of exponents in this expression, we skip E and go directly to M\n\nAnother example:\nWhat is (6 * 3 + 5<sup>2</sup> – 6) + 4<sup>2</sup> – 8 + 6\n-The first thing to notice is that there are numerous operations in the parenthesis, so we apply PEMDAS to simplify 6 * 3 + 5<sup>2</sup> – 6 first.\n6 * 3 + <b>5<sup>2</sup></b> – 6 =\n<b>6 * 3</b> + 25 – 6 =\n<b>18 + 25</b> – 6 =\n<b>43 – 6</b> =\n<b>37</b>\n-We skipped P and D above since there were no parentheses or division in this equation.\n-Now we replace (6 * 3 + 52 – 6) with 37, giving us: 37 + 4<sup>2</sup> – 8 + 6\n37 + <b>4<sup>2</sup></b> – 8 + 6 =\n<b>37 + 16</b> – 8 + 6 =\n53 <b>- 8 + 6</b> =\n<b>53 – 2</b> =\n<b>51</b> (Final Answer)\n-We skipped P, D, and M above since there were no more parentheses, no division symbols, and no multiplication symbols in the equation.\n\nChained-Parenthesis Example:\nWhat is (63 – 43 + (18 * 4 + 12) – 15) + 16 * 2 + 14?\n-Start by finding the rightmost “(“.

    <string name = "alg1_BE"><b>Balancing Equations</b>\n\nThink of equations as a scale where both sides must remain perfectly balanced no matter what. If you remove something from one side of the scale, then something of equal value must be removed from the other side. The same applies to addition. We will apply this concept to reformatting equations such that only certain terms will be on the left and the right side (i.e terms with x and y on the left side and numbers on the right side).\n\nFor example, let’s take the equation <b>x + 7 = 10</b>, and we want to reformat the equations so that there are no numbers on the left side. We first look at the left side, and see that the only number on the left side is positive 7 (if the left side were x – 7 instead, the number would be negative 7). Naturally in order negate this positive 7, we must do the opposite of adding 7: subtracting 7. So we subtract 7 from the left side; however, because the equation is a scale that needs to always be perfectly balanced, we must also subtract 7 from the right side as well.\n<b>x + 7 – 7 = 10 – 7 (Subtracting 7 from both sides)</b>\n<b>x = 3 (Simplified)</b>\n\nAnother example: x – 7 = 10, we have only x on the left side and a number on the right side\nAs stated above, the number on the left side of the equation is negative 7. In order to remove this negative number, we must do the opposite of it: adding 7. Again, since the equation needs to a perfectly balanced scale, we must add 7 to both sides.\n<b>x – 7 + 7 = 10 + 7 (Adding 7 to both sides)\nx = 17 (Simplified)</b>\n\n<b>When an equation is simplified to a form where there’s a single variable on 1 side and a number on the other, we have obtained the solution of that equation for that 1 variable. In the case of the equations previously used, we have obtained the whole solution for the equation since the equation only has 1 variable.</b>\n\nAnother example: x + 5 = 10, x on the right side and number on the left side\nWe start by noticing that x is on the left side and the 10 is on the right side, which is the opposite of what it should be. We can start the problem by moving either the x or the 10.\n\n<b>Moving x, then moving 10:</b>\n<b>x + 5 – x = 10 – x</b> (subtracting x from both sides to remove it from the left)\nBecause there is no x term that is opposite of subtracting x (there is no positive x term on the right side), there is nothing to negate it. This means that once we move the x term over, an x term will appear on the right side. Don’t worry about the fringe cases where moving over variable terms over ends up cancelling all of them out, leaving you with no items with that variable.\n<b>5 = 10 – x</b> (10 is still on the right side. We want constants on the left side, so the next step is subtracting 10 from both sides).\n<b>5 – 10 = 10 – 10 – x</b>\n<b>-5 = -x</b>\nWe have successfully reformatted the equation such that numbers are on the left side and the x-term is on the right side but we aren’t done yet though. Because there is a negative sign in front of the x term, we must multiply both sides by -1 in order to make the answer look a lot cleaner. So we end up with our final answer of: <b>5 = x</b>.

    <string name = "alg1_SOQ"><b>System of Equations</b>\n\nA system of equations is a set of two or more equations which share the same set of variables/unknowns. When we are solving a system of equations, we are trying to find the numerical values of the variables/unknowns in the system such that when we plug in those numbers, the left side of each equation will equal to the respective right side.\n\nFor example, if we’re given this system of equations:\nx + 2y = 3\n6x - y = 4\nIf we put in x = 1 and y = 2, then we end up with:\n3 = 3\n4 = 4\nThus x = 1 and y = 2 solves this system of equation.\n\nSo how do we solve a system of equations?\nThe first step we do in solving a system of equations is making sure that for all equations in the system, all variables and numbers are lined up. If they are not, then you must move around parts of each equation to ensure that it. You may rearrange the equations in whatever format you may please, as long as similar variables and numbers line up (x terms like up with x terms, y terms like up with y terms, 2 lines up with 6, etc.).\nFor example:\nx + 7y = 10\n2x - 5 =  y\nLet’s say we want the equations in the format where x and y are on the left side, with y being right after x, and all numbers will be on the right side of the equation. The first equation is already in this format, so we leave it alone. The second equation is not in this format, so we must re-arrange it so that it will be. We can start by removing from the right side by subtracting y from both sides.\n2x - 5 = y => 2x - 5 - y = 0\nAs we can see from the left side, we want y to right after y so we switch – 5 and – y.\n2x - 5 - y = 0 => 2x - y - 5 = 0\nWe want 5 to be on the right side now; as we can see on the left side, we are subtracting 5. Naturally in order to remove it, we must add 5 to both sides.\n2x - 5 - y = 0 => 2x - y = 5\nNow both variables are on the left side (with the y term being right after the x term) and all numbers on the right side.\nSo our system as of right now is:\nx + 7y = 10\n2x – y = 5\n\nThe next step is to eliminate x. We can do so by multiplying one of the equations by a number so that the x terms in both equations are exactly the same. If we look at our system of equations, we have: x and 2x as our respective x terms.\nSo, we can either:\n-Multiply equation #1 by 2.\n-Multiply equation #2 by ½. (Fractions are fairy nasty to deal with early on, so you want to always go for multiplying by a flat number for now).\nSince it’s easier to deal with whole numbers rather than fraction, we will multiply equation #1 by 2.\nOur system of equations is now:\n\n2x + 14y = 20\n2x – y = 5\n\nThe next step to remove the x term from the first equation by subtracting the second equation from it. Because we had previously scaled the equation such that they both have the same x term, by subtracting one equation from the other we remove the x term from the first equation. You can also subtract the first equation from the second; however when you are just starting to learn algebra, it’s much easier to have a set, unchanging process for solving these problems.\nAfter subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n<b>(2x + 14y) – (2x – y) = 15</b>\nWhen we simplify we get:\n<b>(2x + 14y) – 2x + y = 15\n14y + y = 15 (We have a positive 2x term – 2x, which is equal to 0!)\n15y = 15\ny = 1</b>\nWe now know that y = 1 is the solution for the y part of our system of equations. Then what do we do with it?\n\nWe now can plug y = 1 into any one of the 2 original equations, and then solve for x because <b>by plugging in the solution for y, we reduce the equation to a form where there’s only an x term and a number. By reformatting the equation to where there’s the x term on one side and the number on the other, we can divide both sides by the number x is being multiplied by (aka a constant) in order to obtain the x term.</b>\n\nSo let’s substitute the y term (swapping out the y variable for the number it represents) in both of the original equations and see what happens.\n\n<b>For original equation 1:</b>\ nx + 7y = 10 => <b>x + 7(1) = 10 => x + 7 = 10\nx + 7 – 7 = 10 – 7 (Remove 7 from the left side by subtracting 7 from both sides)\nx = 3</b>\n\n<b>For original equation 2:</b>\n2x – 5 = y => <b>2x – 5 = 1\n2x – 5 + 5 = 1 + 5 (Remove subtracting 5 from the left side by adding 5 to both sides)\n2x = 6\nx = 3 (Number in front of the x term is 2, so we divide both sides by 2 to remove it)</b>\n\nAs you can see plugging in y = 1 into both equations get us the same value for x. If you do not obtain the same values from plugging in the y value you obtained, then you have probably made an arithmetic error on at least 1 of the equations\n\nHuman error is natural, so it’s fine if you mess up on solving them; however, as you get more and more used to solving them, you will be making less and less human errors.\n\nWhen you have gotten to the step where you are subtracting 1 equation from another to solve for 1 variable, sometimes you will get an equation with no variables at all. This does not mean you have messed up; it simply means that the system of equations either has infinitely many solutions or no solutions at all.\n-If you end up with 0 = 0, then there are infinite solutions\n-If you end with 0 = some number, then there are no solutions</string>
    <string name = "alg1_LEaWP"><b>Linear Equations and Word Problems</b>\n\nOften times in algebra (and beyond), you will be given a word problem where you are given no equations whatsoever and expected to come up with the equations yourself and solve them. So given the information in the problem, how do you derive an equation/equations from a problem?\n\n<b>Example 1:</b>\nLet’s say you bought a shirt for $12, and you bought a pair of shoes for $6 more than twice the price of the shirt. How much did you spend on the shoes?\n\nBefore we do anything, <b>read the problem first</b> and see if the question has already solved the problem. Sometimes, the problems will be written to trick you to doing more work than you need to!\n\nFirst, we identify the more complicated price (the price that’s not a flat number), and see that it’s the shoes. For simplicity’s sake let’s ignore everything that’s not related to the price of the shoes, meaning that <b>we will treat the price of the shirt as an unknown for now</b>. Now we will set up an equation to represent it. $6 more tells us there will be a “+ 6” in our equation, and twice the price of the shoes we will have a “2x” term in our equation, where x is the price of the shoes (remember, we represent and replace unknowns with variables to make things less wordy).  These 2 parts contain everything relating to the price of shoes, so we’re done and combine them to get:\n<b>2x + 6 as the price of our shoes</b>\nAs previously stated, we used x to represent our unknown of the price of the shirt. Now we will reread the problem to find the price of the shirt. The price of the shirt has been stated to be $12, so we have x = 12. Because this equation is simplified to the furthest extent and gives us the exact value that x represents, we will now replace x with 12, giving us:\n<b>2(12) + 6 = 24 + 6 = 30\nFinal answer: We have spent $30 on a pair of shoes.</b>\n<b>Example 2:</b>\nBob bought a pack of binder paper for $3. He bought a binder for $4 less than three times the amount he spent on the binder paper. How much did his binder cost?\n<b>Identify the most complicated price: the binder\nIdentify unknown in the price and replace it with a variable: the binder paper\nIdentify components of that price: -4, 3x (x is the variable I used to represent the cost of the paper)\nCombine components to get an equation: 3x – 4\nReread the problem to get the value of x (binder paper price): 3\nReplace x with 3: 3(3) – 4\nSolve: 3(3) -4 = 9 – 4 = 5 (FINAL ANSWER)</b>\n\<b>Example 3:</b>\nFries at a restaurant cost $2. A burger cost $3 less than 4 times that amount. How much does the fries cost?<b>$2. Read the problem carefully and notice what it’s asking for.</b>\n\n<b>Example 4 (Age problem):</b>\nIn 4 years, Alice will be twice as old as she is as of now. How old is Alice now?\n\nFor these types of problems, you will create two different equations that represent the same thing. Both equations share the same unknown (for example, in this problem the unknown is how old Alice is now), so when we set them equation to each other, we will end up with the number that represents the unknown.\n\nThe first part that we should immediately focus on is the part that says “in 4 years”. This tells us that we will add 4 to her current age. Her current age (as of right now), is an unknown, so we represent it as ‘x’. So we have:\n<b>x + 4 as her age in the future</b>\nReading the problem again, it is shown that in the future of 4 years from now,  her age will also be twice of what it is. So we also have:\n<b>2x as her age in the future as well</b>\nHow this problem works is it will provide you with 2 conditions that rely on the same unknown for you to set up and both these conditions are equivalent. So by setting the 2 conditions equal to each other, you will be able to solve for the unknown, which is what the problem is asking for. Set both conditions equal to each other and simplify/solve:\n<b>x + 4 = 2x\n4 = x (subtract x from both sides)</b>x represents her current age, so this equation tells us that Alice’s current age is <b>4</b>.</string>
